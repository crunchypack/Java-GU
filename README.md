# Java Beta Critic

This is an old project I worked on with several other classmates when I studied in GÃ¶teborgs Universitet.
The students included:

* Carl-Oscar Persson
* Natalie Davidsson
* Peili Ge
* Petroula Theodoridou
* **Simon Lobo**
* Yurou Zhao

### The application
This program uses a database to store and present reviews of books, games and movies.  
The entire program was written in java. We used mySQL database. 

### Running the app
There is no server running the database so the entire app runs locally, an .sql file is included to get you started.The _settings.txt_ is used for the connector to the database change it based on your credentials. It's recommended to not use root for your database.
